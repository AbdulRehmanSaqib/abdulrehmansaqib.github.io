The statement “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad (PBUH) is the messenger of Allah Almighty” is the Islamic shahadah, which one recites to embrace Islam. Despite having around 1.4 billion Muslims globally and 26 Muslim countries, there is no submissive system in place today, as it was during Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) time. The reason for this is that Western culture and media have a more profound influence on us than our own traditional and cultural values. You may be wondering about my point or where I am headed with this, and honestly, even I am not sure. However, if you attempt to perceive things from my perspective, you may be able to comprehend the message I am trying to convey.

## Corrupted Mindset 
As mentioned earlier, the rapid growth of Islam worldwide is a source of joy for Muslims. However, those who embrace the faith often fail to understand the responsibility that comes with reciting the Islamic shahadah. Many people believe that observing the basic pillars of Islam, such as performing five daily prayers, paying zakat, and fasting during Ramadan, is the only responsibility they have as Muslims. Although these are essential aspects of Islam, being a true Muslim requires much more. As the Quran states, “O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely…” (2:208). Some converts to Islam only focus on praying and becoming more spiritual, which is important but not enough to secure a successful hereafter. Unfortunately, our ancestors failed to carry on the legacy of the golden Islamic age, and our mindset became corrupted over time due to various factors.

## Islam as an Ideology
If we observe Islam today, it is often seen less as a religion or system (deen) and more as an ideology (mazhab), even though the term "mazhab" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. We need to comprehend how Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) propagated Islam from its inception in Arabia. It is argued that Prophet (PBUH) was a messenger of Allah Almighty and had a higher intellect and authority than any of us, but what about the companions of the Prophet (PBUH) such as Abu Bakr (R.A), Umer Ibn Khattab (R. A), Usman Ibn Affan (R.A), and Ali Ibn Abi Talib (R.A)? They were ordinary people like us, but they had the privilege of learning from the Prophet (PBUH) during His lifetime, which undoubtedly had a more profound impact on them. Nonetheless, we still have the Qur'an, which is exactly the same as it was in the Prophet's (PBUH) time. We possess the Sunnah, precisely organized based on its authenticity. We have the history of our heroes and role models from the Islamic golden age, leaving us with no valid excuses.

## A Religion of Peace
Can the religion of Islam be considered as a religion of peace? The word Islam is derived from the Arabic word “salam,” meaning peace, which teaches the concept of peace through its teachings. However, it is important to note that while Islam does teach the concept of peace, it cannot be categorized as a religion of peace due to its origin from extreme suffering and the emphasis on submission to Allah. The point I am trying to clarify is that we can't endorse something that is inappropriate or unlawful in the name of peace. As Benjamin Franklin once said, righteousness should always be chosen over peace. Islam emphasizes submission to Allah’s commands above all else, as demonstrated by Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his own son without hesitation. While the Qur’an teaches ethics and the relationship between God and creation, it also emphasizes the importance of following God's orders, even if it requires putting aside our worldly desires and relationships. This is known as submission, as the orders from the Qur’an and Sunnah are considered to be the truth or Haqq without any doubt.

## Solution
The remedy for the current Fitnah crisis is quite simple, which is to acquire knowledge of our religion. This entails learning about the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), His companions, and the true essence of Islam. We must strive to develop a closer relationship with Allah by dedicating time to remember Him, particularly during the night, and seeking His assistance as He is An-Naseer. This is the most straightforward and sole solution in the present era of Fitnah. May Allah grant us guidance to follow the right path, the path of His and Prophet (PBUH). Ameen.
