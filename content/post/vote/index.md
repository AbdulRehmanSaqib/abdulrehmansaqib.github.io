## SOME BACKGROUND
I have been old enough to vote for sometime now, but have never voted. The election of this year, 2024, my father was reluctant that i voted. He did not tell whom but that i just do it. I from a very early age have never liked politics because from what i have observed watching the adults of society or the emotionally unstable politicians on the news channel, is that everything has a price. They will talk in a way that is neither true nor false and they are just businessmen.

So i have tried to stay away from conversations related to politics no matter if they were in the tv lounge or between freinds at some tea shop. But currently i have started taking a interest in politcs because i have realized that it is not just a very important skill but might be crucial that could shape the outcome of your life.

Just like oxygen politics is everywhere and practiced by everyone, be it a baby who just learned to walk, or individuals whose  displeasure can change the geopraphy of the world. 

But i digress, lets get back to the topic of voting. Long story short, politics take morality and ethics as foundational elements upon which it is built. And i base my political thought is based upon the Islamic belief of Oneness of God, Allah., which is the most key principle and everything that follows.

Then considering that, let me take you through how i now look at voting, i knew that voting in Pakistan was like banging your head against the wall and also seemed wrong ISLAMICALLY but could not put my fingers areound it. But recently as i have actively focused on attaining some benifical knowledge of Quran and Hadees, i have found words and arguments that have helped me give a new perspective.

## WHO GETS TO LEGISLATE
Who gets to lesgislate, make rules, and why do we need to follow them, lets start with the why, because we humen beings when are social creatures and tend to prosper when we are in a group or tribes. And when you are a part of society, for the society to act as a whole and move in the diection of prosperity not destruction it needs to follow some rules and everyone, must act upon them. 

But who gets to make them, who do we give this kind of power to decide the future of, in this case a country or even the world, since we are living in a Global Village. I personally think no human is intelligent or selfless enough, to be given this power of legislation, and if your answer was democracy. Then, i dont believe true democracy exists anywhere. Secondly, potential vulnerability of democratic systems to what is sometimes called the "tyranny of the majority".

Now try finding the answer of "who" in Islam. Who do we pray our salah to? To Allah. And does someone become a kafir if we prays to someone else? Obviously yes. Because he went again the most basic things islam that is the oneness of Allah in our Kalamah

>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ<br>
> I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, Who has no partner; and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.<br>
> — <cite>Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 2, Hadith Number 24</cite>

There are several kinds of shirk, but the one I explained above is the one where you associate partners with Allah(shirk bi'l-dhat). There is another kind in which one gives an attribute of Allah to someone other than Allah(shirk bi'l-sifat), almost every muslim is aware of the 99 names of Allah, that are his attributes and can take a person out of the fold of Islam.

One of these attributes is sovereignty, the right to legislate. Allah says in the Quran.

> إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ<br>
>All authority to govern rests only with Allah.<br>
> — <cite>12:40</cite>

Next in the same ayah, he says,

>أَمَرَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّآ إِيَّاهُ ۚ<br>
> He has commanded that you serve none but Him.<br>
> — <cite>12:40</cite>


First, Allah says legislation, then he exmphasises on worship. From this we understand that giving the right to legislate is also an act of worship.

>وَلَا يُشْرِكُ فِى حُكْمِهِۦٓ أَحَدًۭا<br>
>He allows none to share His authority.<br>
> — <cite>18:26</cite>

Allah mentions in various verses that legislation belongs only to him. Just as praying to someonelse can make us a kafir, would, according to these ayahs, associating someone else in his rights or attributes, would that not make us a disbeliever?

## THE PRESIDENT IS NOT MY LORD
>ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَـٰنَهُمْ أَرْبَابًۭا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَـٰهًۭا وَٰحِدًۭا ۖ لَّآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ سُبْحَـٰنَهُۥ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ<br>
>They take their rabbis and their monks for their lords apart from Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Mary, whereas they were commanded to worship none but the One True God. There is no god but He. Exalted be He above those whom they associate with Him in His Divinity.<br>
> — <cite>9:31</cite>

>Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded a Hadith via several chains of narration, from Adi bin Hatim, may Allah be pleased with him, who became Christian during the time of Jahiliyyah. When the call of the Messenger of Allah reached his area, Adi ran away to Ash-Sham, and his sister and several of his people were captured. The Messenger of Allah freed his sister and gave her gifts. So she went to her brother and encouraged him to become Muslim and to go to the Messenger of Allah .<br>
Adi, who was one of the chiefs of his people (the tribe of Tai’) and whose father, Hatim At-Ta’i, was known for his generosity, went to Al-Madinah. When the people announced his arrival, Adi went to the Messenger of Allah wearing a silver cross around his neck. The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah; (They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah).<br>
Adi commented, "I said, They did not worship them.’"<br>
The Prophet said, "Yes they did. They (rabbis and monks) prohibited the allowed for them (Christians and Jews) and allowed the prohibited, and they obeyed them. This is how they worshipped them."<br>
The Messenger of Allah said to Adi, "O Adi what do you say Did you run away (to Ash-Sham) so that ‘Allahu Akbar’ (Allah is the Great) is not pronounced Do you know of anything greater than Allah What made you run away Did you run away so that La ilaha illallah’ is not pronounced Do you know of any deity worthy of worship except Allah."<br>
The Messenger invited Adi to embrace Islam, and he embraced Islam and pronounced the Testimony of Truth. The face of the Messenger of Allah beamed with pleasure and he said to Adi, "Verily, the Jews have earned the anger (of Allah) and the Christians are misguided." <br>
> — <cite>Tafsir Ibn Kathir for 9:31</cite>

Now whats the point of all this now. Lets try applying this to the rulers of this age. Are the rulers not making halal what Allah made haram, and vice versa. Some of the examples for Pakistan are;

*   Transgender Bill
*   Alcohol Business Bill
*   Excuse Bill on Kashmir Stand
*   Bill to continue Interest Economy
*   Non-Sharia Education Curriculum Bill
*   A bill to oppose disciplinary actions against army
*   Exscuse Bill for Not helping Palestine etc. 

Are the people who support these rulers, not worshipping them according to these ayahs?

Allah says;

> وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَـٰفِرُونَ<br>
>And Those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are indeed the unbelievers.<br>
> — <cite>5:44</cite>


>وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّـٰلِمُونَ<br>
>And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.<br>
> — <cite>5:45</cite>


> وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَـٰسِقُونَ<br>
>and those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are the transgressors.<br>
> — <cite>5:47</cite>

Now, what do we understand from all this, that whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, we who support them are, disbelivers, oppresors and hypocrites. And ultimately on shirk

## STILL SOMETHING IS LEFT
As i said before, that whoever supports them in their un-Islamic laws and policies, they are also considered as one of them, so we have to stop supporting them but that is only half the work. Not only we have to stop supporting them, but we also have to also reject them openly and publically. And why is this necessary? 

Because the Quran says:
> ٱلْغَىِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱلطَّـٰغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ<br>
> Hence he who rejects the false deities(Taghut) and believes in Allah
> — <cite>2:256</cite>

Because it is funadamental to our faith and without it we can not be considered true believers. The Quran mentions rejecting the false deities (Taghut) and  then believes in Allah. We cant be muslims without it. 

Now what is **Taghut**?
Most of us muslims have not even heard of this word before. Then how can we be muslims, if we dont even know about it? To put simply, we muslims believe that all authority and sovereignty belongs to Allah alone. And he place humen beings on this world to implement his laws and rules. But when some people or institutions try to usurp this authority of Allah, and make their own laws and rules, they become **Taghut**. But taghut is not only the ruler who makes un-Islamic laws, but also the people who support them. For example, that people who have given Hazrat Isa (Jesus), the title of God. We know that Hazrat Isa never preached what they now pratice. So obviously Hazrat Isa is not a taghut but the act of people who worship him, is.

So what do you think? Unless we reject taghut, openly and then bare witness of oneness of Allah. Can we be muslims?


## DISCLAIMER
I am not scholar of Islam but just a mere student. I don't intent to give a fatwa nor am I eligible to give one. This is just to share what i have learned during my journey to understand the Deen of Allah.
