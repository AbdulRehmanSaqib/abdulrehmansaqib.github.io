## The Primacy of Faith and Accountability Over Temporal Concerns
Is the issue of Palestine more important and necessary for faith and accountability, then the liberation of Jerusalem and can Muslims fulfill this responsibility merely through their old "hoo-ha" and temporary emotional outbursts?

## Dilution of Religious Obligations
Currently, the majority of Muslims, due to their lack of knowledge or understanding, or driven by their audacity, are living their lives without adhering to the **perfect obedience** to Allah and the **complete following** of the Prophet's teachings.

## Prioritizing Temporal Causes Over Religious Duties
Instead of focusing on the fundamental and crucial task of Islam, upon which every Muslim's salvation and success in the Hereafter are dependent, today the majority of Muslims are content with merely speaking out on the issue of Palestine, boycotting the products of enemy forces and nations, and engaging in relief activities for Palestine. They consider these temporary activities to be significant religious services and believe they guarantee paradise in the Hereafter.

## Criticism Faced by Those Who Advocate True Religious Duties
Anyone attempting to draw attention to the real essence of religion and religious responsibilities, and merely informing them about the reality of these temporary activities, is faced with severe criticism, being labeled as hypocritical, agents of disbelief, or members of Satan's party. Is the thief scolding the police officer?

## Significance of Faith Amidst Temporal Struggles
In the transient and exigent circumstances of the world, exhibiting sadness and expressing grief as well as doing whatever possible within one's capacity, all while maintaining faith, serve as signs of the existence of faith. However, this sign remains a secondary consideration because amidst the eternal struggle between truth and falsehood, there are also spiritual tests of faith and action that this Ummah finds itself disinterested and helpless in.

## Historical Precedents of Neglecting True Religious Duties
Neglecting this, Muslims have previously seen;

* The fall of the Ottoman Caliphate,
* The illicit creation of Israel in 1948,
* The Zionist occupation of Jerusalem, the third holiest site for Muslims, in 1967,
* The atrocities committed against the unarmed Muslims of occupied Kashmir,
* The extreme violence and unlawful killings in Bosnia and Chechnya,
* The limiting of lives, faith, and actions of Muslims in India,
* The countless atrocities committed against the Muslims of Burma,
* The numerous stories of oppression and tyranny against the residents of former East Pakistan,
* The inhumane treatment imposed on Biharis after the establishment of Bangladesh,
* The demolition of Babri Mosque, the assault on the dignity of Muslim women, and other desecrations of Islamic symbols in India,
* The digging of graves of the proud Muslims of Afghanistan,
* The attacks on the honor of the Companions (RA) and Islamic symbols,
* The attacks on the significant belief of the Finality of Prophethood,
* Tll attempts at blasphemy against the Prophet (PBUH),
* The numerous desecrations of the Holy Quran,
* The diabolical intrigues and shameless actions of the current custodians of the Holy Sanctuaries,
* The dominance and exploitation of anti-Islamic international and national institutions and personalities over other countries,
* And finally, the complete silence, lack of strategy, and criminal negligence and ignorance regarding the re-establishment and revival of the Caliphate.
  
This rebellious and obstinate Ummah has always been content with its ancient "hoo-ha" due to its impatience, lack of understanding, and emotionalism. Indeed, the rapidly passing time bears witness that this unfortunate Ummah has not seen any significant, lasting, and permanent solution or success in any matter to date, and it never will, even until the Day of Judgment.

## Present Ummah's Distress
The current afflicted Ummah has not been able to escape from this humiliation, disgrace, and deprivation of being "lost in the land" (Quran, Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 26) in the past, the present is the abyss of misery, and it will definitely not be able to escape in the future because here, even the mention of the first brick of the building is absent. The interesting thing is that this worst state is not only of the Prophet's (peace be upon him) discordant Ummah but also, unfortunately, the Phoenix among the Prophet's inheritors. And this is the "knot of the matter." Those whose ranks are exceptional, their difficulties are exceptional. When the guardians and protectors of the religion themselves will remain under the control of Satan based on their worldly interests and lowly desires, away from the struggle of establishing this foremost obligation, the Caliphate, then the general public is, in any case, less responsible than them.

## Intoxication with Neglecting Religious Obligations
Neglecting the primary duty is an addiction that, like a habitual addict, considers only being happy and content in the present as its success. Thus, it has no connection with its past (home and family) and neither with its future (family and children). This addiction, whether it be snuff, alcohol, cannabis, or the trade of distorted and false religious beliefs and practices, has a deceptive charm that makes it capable of keeping itself and society away from the actual truth and realities.

## Disregard for Religious Duties by Intellectuals
Similarly, countless corrupt scholars among the Muslim Ummah today are living their lives in such a state of intoxication and enchantment due to their short-sightedness and misdeeds that they neither care about the disgrace they bring to their ancestors and elders nor have any connection left with the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH). These self-serving, opportunistic, wealth-worshipping, and conscience-selling scholars have no relationship with the practical traditions of the Prophet (PBUH).

## Neglecting True Leadership and Action
If this were not the case, they would neither be in a state of misery and inaction themselves nor would they leave the Ummah free to this state of misery and inaction. Instead, they would be leading the society in "the actual tasks to be done" rather than engaging in the formality of holding a Palestine Conference in the Convention Centre Islamabad. They would themselves come forward and set an example by engaging in the field based on Islamic and hereafter priorities, and they would be seen grooming the minds of the Ummah on the pulpit of the Prophet (PBUH) and other occasions on the basis of "not fearing the blame of any blamer" (Quran, Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 54). They would be able to show the system of social justice of Islam not only to the responsive Ummah but also to the invited Ummah.

## Conclusion
But the thought-provoking moment is that the freshness of thought and action that the elite and the masses of the Ummah are showing on the "oppression on Gaza and Palestine," why do they not see the violation of the definitive text, "Indeed, the rule is for none but Allah" (Quran 12:40)?
