## Why Allah Chose Umar Ibn Khattab (R.A) over Amr ibn Hisham
(Abu Jahl)?

 In a book by Michael H. Hart titled “The 100: The Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in the History”, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is ranked first. Despite being Jewish, Hart was asked about this and responded by stating that the Prophet (PBUH) was the only individual to have succeeded supremely on both religious and secular levels. The list also places Jesus (A.S) in third position, Moses (A.S) in fifteenth and Umar ibn Khattab (R.A) at fifty-two. Four Muslims are included on the list, three of whom were messengers of Allah, with the fourth being a companion of the Prophet (PBUH).

## Umar Ibn Khattab (R.A)

 Umar ibn Khattab (R.A) is renowned as one of the most prominent and influential political leaders in the Islamic history. Ibn Umar narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) prayed, “Oh Allah! Strengthen Islam through the dearest of these two men to you: Abu Jahl or Umar Ibn Khattab (R.A). He said, “And the dearest to him was Umar (R.A).” No one has ever surpassed the greatness of Umar Ibn Khattab (R.A) to this day. His devotion to Islam played a crucial role in spreading Islam globally.

 Umar (R.A) was born in 583 A.D, twelve years after the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). He belonged to the Quraish tribe. Umar's early life was not very pleasant, as his father Al Khattab was harsh and physically abusive towards him. Despite that, Umar (R.A) was well-known for his strong-built body and deep voice. He was so tall that when he rode a horse, his feet would touch the ground. Due to his physical attributes, he was interested in wrestling and other sports.

 Before converting to Islam, Umar (R.A) was a staunch opponent of Muslims and especially the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). He had extreme animosity towards Islam and its followers, due to his belief that Islam was creating divisions among people and disrespecting their ancestors' religion and culture. His opposition to Islam stemmed from his concern for his tribe, which he believed was being split by the new religion.

## Abu Jahl
 Born in the year 570 A.D., Abu Jahl, also known as Amr Ibn Hisham, was a prominent Meccan pagan leader notorious for his oppression of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and Islam. He earned the title "Father of Ignorance".
 Unlike Umar Ibn Khattab (R.A), who was also an enemy of Islam, Abu Jahl's motivation was rooted in his egoistic nature. He accused the Messenger of Allah of being a madman because he did not want to give any advantage to the Banu Hashim over the Banu Makhzum, which was Abu Jahl's tribe. This fundamental difference set them apart. Abu Jahl continued to oppress Islam until he was beheaded by Abdullah Ibn Masud (R.A) during the Battle of Badr in 624 A.D.
His egotistical outlook caused him to be disgraced in this life. We know that ego is an undoubtedly dangerous foe for humans. Iblees also suffered humiliation due to his ego when Allah commanded him to prostrate before Adam (A.S) but he refused, considering himself a superior being to Adam (A.S).

## Umar Ibn Khattab (R.A) Conversion to Islam
Umar (R.A) was gradually exposed to the teachings of Islam by Allah Almighty. His heart was touched by the first ray of the light of faith when he witnessed the women of Quraish, including Umm Abdullah bint Hantamh, leaving their homeland and travelling to a distant land to escape the persecution they were facing from Umar (R.A.) and other unbelievers.Umm Abdullah bint Hantamh said:
“When we were migrating to Abyssinia, Umar, who used to persecute us mercilessly, came and stood over and said to me: are you leaving? I said: Yes, for you have persecuted us and oppressed us, and by Allah we are going out in the land of Allah until Allah grants us a way out.”
Then Umar said:
“May Allah be with you. And I saw kindness that I had never seen before.”

 Another narration from Umar (R.A) comes where he explains that he was really addicted to drinking post-Islam. He used to gather with people and drink a lot. This was Umar (R.A) when he was 27 years of age. One day he went out to drink but couldn’t find his drinking partners. So, he decided to go to Ka’bah and make tawaaf because he had nothing else to do. At that time there were idols in Ka’bah, 360 of them. So they used to worship idols in Ka’bah. So he went there and saw the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) praying in front of Ka’bah alone. Seeing the Prophet (PBUH) standing there alone, he could have attacked him or killed him and hid the evidence but instead, he decided to hear him out and see what he is reading. Because until now he hadn't heard the message of Propet (PBUH) and His teachings. So he went to the opposite side of the Ka’bah then under the cloth of the Ka’bah and started to move towards Prophet (PBUH) while being in the cloth until he was right in front of Prophet (PBUH) and the only thing between me and the Prophet (PBUH) was the cloth of the Ka’bah. Prophet (PBUH) was reciting Qur’an and he started to listen. He listened and listened until it entered his heart and he thought to himself I've never heard anything more beautiful than this. As we know that Umar (R.A) was one of the minority of literate people. He knew how to read and write and also was a poet. He thought to himself that this man is truly a poet as Quraish used to say about Him. The moment Umar (R.A) was thinking this, Prophet (PBUH) happens to be reciting Surah Al Haqqah. “Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the recitation of a noble Messenger. It is not the prose of a poet ˹as you claim˺, ˹yet˺ you hardly have any faith. (69:40-41). Answering Umar’s (R.A) objection that these words are from a poet but from the Messenger of Allah. Umar’s (R.A) thought to himself this man is also a sorcerer, he knows what's going on in my head. Prophet (PBUH) continues with Hid recitation. “Nor is it the mumbling of a fortune-teller, ˹yet˺ you are hardly mindful.” ((69:42). Umar (R.A) said that he was shocked by this incident. He got out of there as soon as possible and got sick for some time. He could have gone to Prophet (PBUH) and said I am ready to be a Muslim but he didn't.

One time, Umar (R.A) encountered Abu Jahl who was publicly soliciting the people of Mecca to assassinate the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The cause of Abu Jahl's anger was the Prophet's (PBUH) interference with their familial relationships and the condemnation of their idols. It is possible that the catalyst for this hostility was the conversion of Hamza Ibn Abdulmuttalib (PBUH) to Islam, as it was a significant moment in the faith's history. In response to Abu Jahl's call to violence, Umar (R.A) announced his intention to kill the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), brandishing his sword and advancing toward him. Along the way, he was intercepted by Nuaym ibn Abdullah (R.A), who had also secretly converted to Islam. Nuaym (R.A) attempted to dissuade Umar by suggesting that he first address his own family's conversion to Islam, including his sister Fatima bint al-Khattab (R.A) and her husband Saʿīd ibn Zayd (R.A), before seeking retribution against the Prophet (PBUH). Nuaym's (PBUH) strategy was to delay Umar's (R.A) pursuit of the Prophet in order to give time for the Prophet (R.A) to seek refuge. Umar then made his way to his sister's house, where he overheard Khabbab ibn al-Aratt (R.A) teaching Qur'an to Fatima and Saʿīd. Upon discovering their conversion to Islam, Umar viciously assaulted them, causing Fatima's face to bleed. Despite the brutality of the attack, Fatima and Saʿīd remained steadfast in their faith, even telling Umar to kill them if he so desired. Witnessing this display of courage, Umar was struck with embarrassment and sat down to contemplate his actions. He then requested to see the pages of the Qur'an. Fatima requested that he first cleanse himself before handling the holy text. After doing so, Umar was allowed to read the Qur'an and was ultimately moved to embrace Islam. He then proceeded to Dar Al-Arqam, where the Prophet secretly taught the Qur'an to a small number of Muslims. It was there that Umar became the 40th person to embrace Islam, just three days after his uncle Hamza (PBUH) had done so. This event marked a significant turning point in the history of Islam, as Umar's (R.A) conversion brought a powerful figure into the fold and helped to bolster the faith's legitimacy. Umar (R.A) said
"I remember that when I became Muslim, there were just thirty-nine men with the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.), and I brought the number to forty."
Abdullah Ibn Masood (R.A.) said:
"We felt a sense of pride when Umar became Muslim, for we could not circumambulate the Holy Mosque and pray until Umar became Muslim. When he became Muslim, he fought them until they sent us free. Then we prayed and circumambulated the Kaaba."
He also said:
"Umar's becoming a Muslim was a victory, his migration was help, and his caliphate was a mercy. We could not pray or circumambulate the House until Umar became Muslim. When he became Muslim, he fought the unbelievers until they left us alone and let us pray."

## Sayings of Umar (R.A) that Became Well-Known Wisdom

Umar (R.A.) once stated that whoever conceals their secrets can choose who they share them with. However, those who speak or act deceitfully should not be surprised if others think poorly of them. Instead, one should strive to interpret their words in a positive light until they are sure of their true intentions. Umar (R.A.) also advised against excessive swearing, as it may lead to humiliation. He reminded his listeners that there is no better response to someone who disobeys Allah concerning them than obeying Allah concerning that person. Finally, Umar (R.A.) urged his audience to seek out sincere friends and maintain strong relationships with them, as they are a source of comfort in times of ease and support in times of hardship.

When Umar (R.A.) sent out his army, he would remind them to fear Allah and then say, 
"In the name of Allah and with Allah's help, proceed with Allah's backing and support. Adhere to truth and patience. Fight in the cause of Allah against those who disbelieve in Him and do not disobey, for Allah does not like disobedience. Do not be a coward in battle and do not mutilate your enemies when you have the upper hand. Do not be excessive in your conquests and do not argue during battle. Avoid killing women, children, and the elderly, even in the heat of battle. Do not become too attached to the spoils of war or seek worldly honours through jihad. Rejoice in the profit gained from the transaction and consider it a great success."
