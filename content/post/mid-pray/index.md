The importance of midnight prayers and azkaars can be seen in both, the word of Allah which is indeed the Qur’an and the saying of the Prophet (PBUH). The Prophet (PBUH) used to dedicate a part of this night in remembrance of Allah Almighty and also encouraged others to do the same.

Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Our Lord, the Blessed, the Superior, comes every night down on the nearest Heaven
 to us when the last third of the night remains, saying: "Is there anyone to invoke Me, so that I may respond to his invocation? Is there anyone to ask Me, so that I may grant him his request? Is there anyone seeking My forgiveness, so that I may forgive him?" (Sahih al-Bukhari 1145)

Take a look at this beautiful hadith which tells us how the Almighty himself descends into the lowest heaven and calls out to people. He is ready to give away all the blessings that one could imagine but we humans, slaves of our consciousness and this temporary world ignore this and stay busy with our worldly desires.

Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The most beloved fasting to Allah was the fasting of (the Prophet) David, who used to fast alternate days. And the most beloved prayer to Allah was the prayer of David, who used to sleep for (the first) half of the night and pray for 1/3 of it and (again) sleep for a sixth of it." (Sahih al-Bukhari 1146)

This shows that this act of worship was not something in the Prophet’s time but also in the Prophet's way before. Indeed Allah Almighty loves the one who sacrifices one’s sleep for the sake of Allah. Because it is a time of total peace so one can efficiently connect with Allah Almighty leading to better and more effective prayers.

Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The best prayer after the obligatory prayers is the night prayer." (Sahih Muslim 1163)

There are many hadiths showing the importance of midnight prayers and azkaars but there are also Quranic verses regarding this.

1. "Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue] and more suitable for words." (Quran 73:6)

2. "And from [part of] the night, pray with it as additional [worship] for you; it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station." (Quran 17:79)

3. "Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the night and [also] the Qur'an of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed." (Quran 17:78)

4. "And during a part of the night, pray Tahajjud as an additional prayer for you; it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station." (Quran 17:79)

5. "Indeed, the righteous will be among gardens and springs, accepting what their Lord has given them. Indeed, they were before that doers of good. They used to sleep but little of the night." (Quran 51:15-17)

6. "And those who pray, 'Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell. Indeed, its punishment is ever adhering; indeed, it is evil as a settlement and residence.'" (Quran 25:65-66)

7. "Their sides forsake their beds, calling upon their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend." (Quran 32:16)

8. "Establish prayer at the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and [also] the Qur'an of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed." (Quran 17:78)

9. "And those who spend [part of] the night to their Lord prostrating and standing [in prayer]." (Quran 25:64)

10. "And in a part of the night, pray with it as additional worship for you; it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station." (Quran 17:79)

These verses highlight the significance of prayers and worship during the night, particularly in the latter part of it, emphasizing the importance of seeking closeness to Allah and engaging in additional acts of worship during these moments.
